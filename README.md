# DiXcio Flashcard App

I made this project to discover the java language, and to develop my german vocabulary. It is a basic **flashcard** application, with the following features:

- Creating multiple projects
- Adding and editing words
- Browsing the collection, with a search function
- Adding words in bookmarks
- Training function: Makes pop words through different modes: **Random**, **Bookmarked only**, **most failed**, **less encountered**.
- Importing and exporting into **.csv** format


Not the cleanest project ever, but still usable.
